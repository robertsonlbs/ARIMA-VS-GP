# ARIMA-VS-GP

The aim of the project is to compare two machine learning model’s performance in predicting the evolution of a time series in the medium to long term. The models to be analyzed are Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA) and Gaussian Process(GP). Both models are frequently used in the time series context, because they could model the dependencies across time like trend, periodicity, and seasonality reasonably well.

The dataset, NBA.CSV, used here is a time series of popularity of a term, NBA(National Basketball Association), searched in Google. The dataset is obtained from Google Trends, which records Chrome users’ browsing activity since 2004. The NBA.CSV is consisted by monthly popularity of the term from 2006 to 2019(168 samples, which correspond to 14 years).
